                            <mutableString key="text">Today I caught up with Evan Doherty a well established and much sought after Fashion and Commercial Photographer based in Dublin. Evan has been a good friend of mine since we met in 2010 and I was keen to know where his talent in Photography had originated from as I’ve watched his Photography Business soar to success over the past 9 years.

Since an early age Evan had developed a keen interest in many aspects of art, from graffiti to fine art and drawing. Even at this early stage it was apparent that he had an entrepreneurial aspect in his life as he recalls hand drawing pictures of Bob Marley and various musicians and selling them to his other school mates. After leaving school he started working for Irish Ferries and although starting at the very bottom managed to work his way up the ranks until being made redundant in 2006.

This for many people in the company was a disaster but Evan admits for him it was a blessing.
Soon after the opportunity arose for him to attend the IADT in Dun Laoghaire to study Fine Art Photography which was a huge turning point in Evans career.

Evan remembers seeing shots from another student who was working behind the scenes at a fashion photo shoot and was intrigued by the whole studio set up. It was then he decided to contact Barry McCaul a well known photographer with a large celebrity following and fantastic reputation to ask if he could work as an assistant for him. Whilst working in the studio Evan developed a taste for the buzz on set and accumulated many life skills that he maintains set the standard for him. He recalls a time when Barry asked him to work a fashion shoot that was happening the following day in which he declined as he had already arranged to go a party that evening. He was never called back to work after this incident and remembers feeling the disappointment from Barry and claims this was a major lesson learn’t.

Although always a hard worker even from the days working in Irish ferries Evan admits there was definitely a discipline learn’t in College. With an impeccable attendance in his 1st 2 years he recalls spending long days using the dark room and studio facilities that the college had on offer.

Whilst a student at College a family friend arranged for Evan to have a meeting with Michael Heffernan from Dunnes Stores to showcase his portfolio of work which admittedly he says was pretty poor. They agreed to give him a test shoot which in turn sealed the job to shoot a promotional campaign for the company. Totally out of his comfort zone Evan was left responsible to select and book the models, makeup artists etc. Once Evans photographs went to press Dunnes Stores sold out of all stock used in the campaign and his images adorned billboards throughout the country.

Now into his 3rd year in college Evan had started missing days and lectures and admits he was now struggling academically. Following the huge success from the campaign he had started to receive serious exposure and made the decision to drop out of College as he found himself having to turn down the opportunity to work. Although never finishing his degree Evan said college was a fundamental part of his success and during those years technically learned so much.

Not long after leaving college Evan opened his own studio in Dublin City centre where his Business has continued to thrive. So what’s the key to his success? Be reliable, get the job done and keep your standard high!

Since finding his passion in photography so young I was keen to know whether he was now happy in his career choice or would something else be in the pipeline. I think its fair to say that Evan will have his hands firmly on the camera for many more years to come. Something I’m glad to hear as I have reaped the benefits of his talent and expertise in many successful campaigns for BankHouse Media.... </mutableString>
